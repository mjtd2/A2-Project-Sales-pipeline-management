# Sales Pipeline Management
* Open *Sales Pipeline Management.bat* to start the program.
* If this fails, copy the file *Sales Pipeline Management (Developer).bat* from *Data BACKUP* to the folder containing this text document, and try running this file instead. If the program runs, it should now work with *Sales Pipeline Management.bat*.

* Currently, drawing graphs filters the *Current leads* and *Historical data* tables so that they show the same data used by the graphs. To undo this, press the *unfilter* button in the top-right of the two tabs containing the tables.

* Exported graphs will be in the *Exported graphs* folder. Deleting and changing files in here will not affect the program.
* Other folders should not need opening by the user: opening data files which are in use can cause the program to **FAIL TO SAVE DATA**!

* If the program fails to find a file, copy an example file from *Data BACKUP* to *Data*.
